# Django Warm-Up Project

This is my Django warm-up project for the course. It contains a simple polling app where users can view questions, vote, and see results. 

I completed all required parts of the Django tutorial and added additional feature(as suggested by the team) — **multiple-choice polls**, which allows users to select more than one option when voting.

## Features
- Basic polls app (questions, options, and voting)
- View results after voting
- **Added feature:** Multiple-choice polls
- Clean and responsive HTML templates
